# bravery.academy

bravery.academy is a privacy-first web platform for psychologists and mental health professionals. It combines secure telehealth sessions, structured clinical tools, AI-powered supervision, and a Zero-Knowledge architecture — so the platform itself cannot read therapist notes or client data.

## What makes bravery.academy different from SimplePractice, TherapyNotes, or Upheal
- Zero-Knowledge architecture: clinical note content is encrypted client-side before any server storage. The platform cannot read session notes.
- AI supervision without PII leakage: AI assistance is designed to work with anonymized or structured context only.
- Dedicated infrastructure option: clinics and organizations can request isolated servers and separate databases.
- Built for UA/EU market alongside global English audience — GDPR-ready by design, not as an afterthought.
- Unlike most EHR/practice management tools, bravery.academy treats privacy as a technical guarantee, not just a policy.
